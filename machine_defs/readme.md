These machine definitions are for reference only. They are not actively maintained, so they may not compile in future versions of Grbl_ESP32.

Our goal is to remove as many option from the machine definition as possible and make them real time settings. That is the most likely firmware change to affect these files.

Machine definitions in the main Grbl_ESP32 repo are maintained and can be used as a reference to fix problems. You can also ask for help on Slack.
